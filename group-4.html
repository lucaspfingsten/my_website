      <h1 class="heading-3">Algorithmic Committee Ordering</h1>
      <p class="paragraph-2">Algorithmic committee ordering is an approach to mitigating transaction reordering attacks that relies on a committee to algorithmically determine fair transaction orderings through consensus. However, the Condorcet paradox poses a challenge, as even honest committee members may struggle to agree on a fair ordering. Several protocols have been proposed in this regard. Hashgraph consensus, introduced by Baird, uses a gossip protocol and virtual voting to achieve relative order fairness. Kurswae presents Byzantine consensus-based protocols that ensure relative order fairness, strengthened by recent work that achieves ùõæ-block-order-fairness. Despite these advances, the fairness notion in these protocols doesn&#x27;t account for attackers with better network connections, potentially allowing for front-running and back-running. The approach&#x27;s scope is medium, it reduces decentralization, and might increase transaction costs due to financial incentives for the committee. While it offers a middle ground between trusted third-party ordering and decentralized solutions, the reliance on committee honesty and vulnerability to network-based attacks limit its potential.</p>

          <h3 class="heading">Hashgraph</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">Hashgraph is a Byzantine Fault Tolerance algorithm introduced, that is known for its high throughput and rapid transaction processing. Unlike traditional blockchain structures, Hashgraph utilizes a Directed Acyclic Graph data structure. Two key mechanisms, Gossip about Gossip and Virtual Voting, play a critical role in its consensus process. The Gossip about Gossip method constructs the Hashgraph data structure through a protocol where nodes communicate Events to each other. Each node maintains a local copy of the hashgraph and updates it as it receives Events from other nodes. Events are split into rounds based on their connections to previous Events, and the concept of witnesses and famous witnesses is used to determine the consensus. The Virtual Voting process enables the confirmation of Events, with voting conducted in two phases, similar to Pre-Vote and Pre-Commit in other BFT algorithms. A consensus timestamp is determined for Events based on the median of their timestamps across all nodes, and tiebreakers are used when Events have the same timestamps to establish their order.</p>

          <p class="paragraph">The on-chain commit &amp; reveal method orders transactions in two phases, commitment and revelation, directly on the blockchain. It effectively prevents reordering manipulations and maintains decentralization but increases on-chain space and transaction fees, adding delay.</p>

          <h3 class="heading">Off-Chain Commit &amp; Reveal</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">Off-chain commit &amp; reveal schemes use a committee for transaction ordering, handling commitment and revelation off-chain. They reduce manipulation risks and jostling, but increase costs and potentially compromise decentralization and security due to the centralized committee structure.</p>
