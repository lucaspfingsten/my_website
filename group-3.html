      <h1 class="heading-3">Trusted Third Party Ordering</h1>
      <p class="paragraph-2">The trusted third party ordering approach is gaining rapid adoption in mitigating transaction reordering attacks, particularly in decentralized exchanges (DEXes). Services like flashbots, Eden, and OpenMEV rely on trusted third parties to order transactions, bypassing the Ethereum peer-to-peer network. Some DEXes, like SushiSwap and mistX, have integrated these services directly. In ETH 2.0, a similar private ordering concept is being considered, where transactions are sent directly to block proposers, preventing public mempool exposure. Gnosis Protocol and CowSwap adopt a similar approach by sending transactions directly to solvers, eliminating sandwich attacks within batches. Tesseract and Fairy use trusted hardware and TEE to resist front-running, with Tesseract relying on trusted third parties, while Fairy implements fair ordering using TEE. Trusted third party ordering excels in terms of delay, goodput, jostling, and scope, with no expected increase in transaction fees. However, it may have mediocre cost performance as fees could increase over time. On the downside, decentralization and security are compromised, as ordering depends on a trusted third party&#x27;s honesty, potentially allowing manipulation and contradicting the blockchain&#x27;s trustless nature.</p>

          <h3 class="heading">MEV Protect</h3>
          <p class="paragraph methodpar">Multiple providers (Flashbots, Eden, bloXroute, Open MEV, etc.) offer MEV protection services. Users send their transactions directly to the service provider. Thus, the transaction is no longer sent to the public mempool where it can be front run by bots. Instead, these services send bundles directly to miners/validators who have entered into agreements with the respective provider. Some DEXes integrate these services into their UI to make them easily accessible for users. For instance, SushiSwap integrates Eden and PancakeSwap on the Binance Smart Chain integrates TODO. </p>

          <p class="paragraph methodpar">Its a decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure platform designed to enhance the utility and liquidity of Ethereum (ETH) across multiple blockchains without the need for traditional bridges or intermediaries. It achieves this through its innovative &quot;multichain composable ETH,&quot; which allows users to deploy their ETH in superfluid yield-generating activities across various chains simultaneously, maintaining a direct link to the underlying asset for security and redeemability. By providing a composable infrastructure and a yield singularity, Blockswap enables ETH holders to maximize their asset’s efficiency and yield potential in a secure, trustless environment.</p>

          <p class="paragraph methodpar">CowSwap is a decentralized exchange aggregator that tackles the problem of MEV by facilitating trading without the traditional order book or automated market maker system. Instead of executing orders immediately, CowSwap matches opposite orders from users within a batch auction system, allowing for direct swaps when a coincidence of wants is found, reducing slippage and eliminating the opportunity for miners to prioritize transactions for profit. If direct matches aren&#x27;t found, CowSwap uses its underlying Gnosis Protocol to find the best price across several DEXs, ensuring users still get favorable trade conditions while minimizing the impact on the market price and saving on transaction fees.</p>
