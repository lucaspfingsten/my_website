      <h1 class="heading-3">Optimized Trade Execution</h1>
      <p class="paragraph-2">The method discussed in this section focuses on optimized trade execution schemes to mitigate specific attacks in the blockchain ecosystem. These schemes aim to protect users from various types of attacks by optimizing their transactions. Zhou et al. propose A2MM, which automatically identifies arbitrage opportunities and collects them within the same transaction, ensuring that no BEV (Block Extractable Value) is left behind. ZÃ¼st&#x27;s approach splits large transactions vulnerable to sandwich attacks into smaller, unattackable ones. Heimbach and Wattenhofer introduce an algorithm that sets slippage tolerance to prevent sandwich attacks and transaction failures due to natural price movements. These methods do not compromise decentralization, transaction costs, or transaction ordering on the blockchain. However, they may slightly increase competition among similar transactions and lead to minor transaction delays. Despite their limitations in addressing general transaction reordering manipulations, these schemes offer temporary solutions until universal protection mechanisms are implemented.</p>

          <h3 class="heading same-height">A2MM</h3>
          <p class="paragraph methodpar">A2MM is an advanced automated market maker system that aims to minimize arbitrage opportunities between itself and other AMM exchanges. When a swap occurs it checks the size of the swap to determine if synchronization with among multiple AMMs is necessary, after which it executes optimal routing. In scenarios where a trader&#x27;s balance isn&#x27;t sufficient for arbitrage, a flash loan can be invoked. A2MM, therefore, not only facilitates regular trading of assets between liquidity providers and takers but also efficiently handles arbitrage and routing across multiple AMMs, aiming to maximize trading benefits for its users.</p>

          <h3 class="heading same-height">Order Splits as Mitigation Strategy</h3>
          <p class="paragraph methodpar">This protocol outlines the implementation of order splitting as a defense mechanism against sandwich attacks in decentralized exchanges. The strategy involves breaking down large orders into smaller segments to minimize the profitability of sandwich attacks by reducing the price difference caused by the transaction and exchange fees. The process of determining optimal input amounts for split orders takes into account the significance of disregarding transaction fees during the equation-solving process in case of an attack in collaboration with a miner. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the order splitting strategy, revealing that a substantial portion of profitable sandwich attacks could have been prevented through this approach, leading to significant savings for traders.</p>

          <h3 class="heading same-height">Eliminating Sandwich Attacks with the Help of Game Theory</h3>
          <p class="paragraph methodpar">The protocol determines when a transaction is vulnerable to a sandwich attack based on its slippage tolerance and trade size. High slippage tolerances and large trade sizes make the trades susceptible to such attacks. The protocol suggests selecting an appropriate slippage tolerance to strike a balance between the risks of a sandwich attack and the transaction not executing due to price fluctuations. Costs related to failed transactions are factored in, including the price shift between two blocks and the cost of redoing the transaction. The protocol proposes setting the slippage tolerance in such a way that the estimated costs of transaction failure do not surpass the costs of a potential sandwich attack. For large transactions that might face challenges with this balance, the recommendation is to split them into smaller trades to lessen their price impact. </p>
