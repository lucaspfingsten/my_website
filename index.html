            <h2>Group 1: Optimized Trade Execution</h2>
            <p>
                The method discussed in this section focuses on optimized trade execution schemes to mitigate specific attacks in the blockchain ecosystem. These schemes aim to protect users from various types of attacks by optimizing their transactions. Zhou et al. propose A2MM, which automatically identifies arbitrage opportunities and collects them within the same transaction, ensuring that no BEV (Block Extractable Value) is left behind. Z√ºst's approach splits large transactions vulnerable to sandwich attacks into smaller, unattackable ones. Heimbach and Wattenhofer introduce an algorithm that sets slippage tolerance to prevent sandwich attacks and transaction failures due to natural price movements. These methods do not compromise decentralization, transaction costs, or transaction ordering on the blockchain. However, they may slightly increase competition among similar transactions and lead to minor transaction delays. Despite their limitations in addressing general transaction reordering manipulations, these schemes offer temporary solutions until universal protection mechanisms are implemented.            </p>

            <h2>Group 2: Professional Market Makers</h2>
            <p>
                The professional market maker approach goes beyond optimized trade execution by introducing dedicated market makers to redesign DEX systems. These market makers aim to ensure fair orderings of transactions on the blockchain. Two notable implementations are discussed. First, Ciampi et al. introduce FairMM, where a single monopolistic market maker facilitates fair orderings. Buyers create smart contracts, lock capital, and interact off-chain with the market maker to agree on exchange rates and execute transactions on-chain. Hashflow, on the other hand, invites professional market makers to manage liquidity pools and operates in a request-for-quote (RFQ) model. Users request quotes off-chain, and the market maker provides signature-based quotes. Users then execute transactions at the agreed-upon prices on the Ethereum network, with an option to use Uniswap if the price is better. The professional market maker approach exhibits average performance in various areas, primarily focusing on addressing transaction reordering manipulations on DEXes. It may lead to small delays due to off-chain interactions, particularly in the FairMM model, which involves multiple rounds of communication. Costs are not expected to significantly increase, as users can lock capital for multiple transactions, but decentralization is impacted since professional market makers have some control over transaction orderings. Security is a significant concern, as professional market makers could potentially front-run users' transactions, and there are doubts about the feasibility of FairMM's model. Overall, while professional market makers offer a different approach to DEX design, they are not seen as a foolproof solution to transaction reordering attacks on the blockchain.            </p>

            <h2>Group 3: Trusted Third Party Ordering</h2>
            <p>
                The trusted third party ordering approach is gaining rapid adoption in mitigating transaction reordering attacks, particularly in decentralized exchanges (DEXes). Services like flashbots, Eden, and OpenMEV rely on trusted third parties to order transactions, bypassing the Ethereum peer-to-peer network. Some DEXes, like SushiSwap and mistX, have integrated these services directly. In ETH 2.0, a similar private ordering concept is being considered, where transactions are sent directly to block proposers, preventing public mempool exposure. Gnosis Protocol and CowSwap adopt a similar approach by sending transactions directly to solvers, eliminating sandwich attacks within batches. Tesseract and Fairy use trusted hardware and TEE to resist front-running, with Tesseract relying on trusted third parties, while Fairy implements fair ordering using TEE. Trusted third party ordering excels in terms of delay, goodput, jostling, and scope, with no expected increase in transaction fees. However, it may have mediocre cost performance as fees could increase over time. On the downside, decentralization and security are compromised, as ordering depends on a trusted third party's honesty, potentially allowing manipulation and contradicting the blockchain's trustless nature.            </p>

            <h2>Group 4: eUTXO Model</h2>
            <p>
                The eUTXO (extended Unspent Transaction Output) model is a method for mitigating transaction reordering manipulations by ensuring that a transaction executes based on the state it observes at the time of submission, preventing front-running attacks. This model extends the UTXO model used in Bitcoin, where each transaction uses inputs (UTXOs), destroys them, and creates new ones as outputs. In this approach, Lanningham introduced a translation of the Uniswap model to Cardano's eUTXO model in SundaeSwap, where a liquidity pool's liquidity is stored in an eUTXO, effectively simulating a smart contract with an eUTXO. Users interacting with the pool's eUTXO create a new one, limiting transaction throughput to one interaction per block, preventing front-running. While this approach maintains decentralization and security, ensures consistent transaction fees, and successfully prevents front-running BEV, its limited goodput, bottlenecking, and potential delays make it impractical for high-demand use cases, leading to design adjustments in projects like SundaeSwap.            </p>

            <h2>Group 5: Algorithmic Committee Ordering</h2>
            <p>
                Algorithmic committee ordering is an approach to mitigating transaction reordering attacks that relies on a committee to algorithmically determine fair transaction orderings through consensus. However, the Condorcet paradox poses a challenge, as even honest committee members may struggle to agree on a fair ordering. Several protocols have been proposed in this regard. Hashgraph consensus, introduced by Baird, uses a gossip protocol and virtual voting to achieve relative order fairness. Kurswae presents Byzantine consensus-based protocols that ensure relative order fairness, strengthened by recent work that achieves ùõæ-block-order-fairness. Despite these advances, the fairness notion in these protocols doesn't account for attackers with better network connections, potentially allowing for front-running and back-running. The approach's scope is medium, it reduces decentralization, and might increase transaction costs due to financial incentives for the committee. While it offers a middle ground between trusted third-party ordering and decentralized solutions, the reliance on committee honesty and vulnerability to network-based attacks limit its potential.            </p>

            <h2>Group 6: On-Chain Commit & Reveal</h2>
            <p>
                On-chain commit & reveal is a method for ordering transactions directly on the blockchain, consisting of two phases: commitment and revelation. Tatabitovska et al. propose a Uniswap-specific commit & reveal scheme using hash commitments, while Doweck and Eyal use time-lock puzzle commitments and introduce Multi-Party Timed Commitments (MPTC) to tackle the problem. Both approaches maintain decentralization and effectively prevent most transaction reordering manipulations. Jostling is minimal due to hidden transaction contents, and security vulnerabilities are relatively small. However, on-chain commit & reveal has drawbacks. It significantly increases on-chain space requirements, leading to higher transaction fees. The delay between commitment and revelation adds to transaction processing time, making it unsuitable for time-sensitive applications like decentralized exchanges (DEXes) during volatile market conditions, potentially causing market inefficiencies and reduced goodput. Overall, it may find use cases outside of DEXes and lending protocols but falls short of meeting DEXes' delay and cost expectations.            </p>

            <h2>Group 7: Off-Chain Commit & Reveal</h2>
            <p>
                Off-chain commit & reveal schemes, in contrast to their on-chain counterparts, involve two rounds of transactions: commitment and revelation, handled off-chain by a committee. Reiter and Birman, Miller et al., and Asyag et al. propose encrypted Byzantine consensus protocols based on threshold signatures to achieve fair transaction orderings. Users encrypt their transactions using a shared public key, and the committee orders these encrypted transactions. A two-thirds majority of the committee is assumed to be honest. Off-chain commit & reveal offers a wide scope for mitigating various transaction reordering manipulations and effectively reduces jostling due to hidden transaction contents. However, it comes with increased transaction costs, potentially due to blockchain implementations requiring extra space for committee member signatures. This approach is not expected to negatively impact delay or goodput, and it may introduce financial incentives for committee members. While it excels in several aspects, such as scope and jostling, it suffers from reduced decentralization and security. The centralized nature of the committee and the potential for collusion among its members are significant drawbacks in terms of security and decentralization, which are at odds with fundamental blockchain principles.            </p>
