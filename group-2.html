      <h1 class="heading-3">Professional Market Makers</h1>
      <p class="paragraph-2">The professional market maker approach goes beyond optimized trade execution by introducing dedicated market makers to redesign DEX systems. These market makers aim to ensure fair orderings of transactions on the blockchain. Two notable implementations are discussed. First, Ciampi et al. introduce FairMM, where a single monopolistic market maker facilitates fair orderings. Buyers create smart contracts, lock capital, and interact off-chain with the market maker to agree on exchange rates and execute transactions on-chain. Hashflow, on the other hand, invites professional market makers to manage liquidity pools and operates in a request-for-quote (RFQ) model. Users request quotes off-chain, and the market maker provides signature-based quotes. Users then execute transactions at the agreed-upon prices on the Ethereum network, with an option to use Uniswap if the price is better. The professional market maker approach exhibits average performance in various areas, primarily focusing on addressing transaction reordering manipulations on DEXes. It may lead to small delays due to off-chain interactions, particularly in the FairMM model, which involves multiple rounds of communication. Costs are not expected to significantly increase, as users can lock capital for multiple transactions, but decentralization is impacted since professional market makers have some control over transaction orderings. Security is a significant concern, as professional market makers could potentially front-run users&#x27; transactions, and there are doubts about the feasibility of FairMM&#x27;s model. Overall, while professional market makers offer a different approach to DEX design, they are not seen as a foolproof solution to transaction reordering attacks on the blockchain.</p>

          <p class="paragraph methodpar">Operated by Flashbots, this service enables the redistribution of MEV to users, transaction originators, or other designated parties. It involves a process where Users submit their transactions to a Matchmaker, who partially discloses transaction details to searchers to protect Users from front-running and preserver transaction privacy. Searcher’s craft MEV-generating transactions and send them back to the Matchmaker, who completes the bundle with the Users transactions and sets conditions for MEV redistribution. The completed bundle is then sent to Builders, who include it in a block and enforce the redistribution conditions, thus rewarding Users with a share of the MEV generated by their transactions.</p>

          <p class="paragraph methodpar">It’s a DeFi protocol that offers a decentralized exchange platform where users can trade assets across different blockchains without slippage and with guaranteed price quotes. Unlike typical automated market makers used in many DEXs, Hashflow leverages a request-for-quote model to provide traders with guaranteed price quotes directly from professional market makers, avoiding some of the downsides of AMM platforms such as slippage and MEV exploits.</p>

          <p class="paragraph methodpar">Its a decentralized finance protocol operates by aggregating liquidity and orders into a single pool where they are matched. Trades are executed in a manner that conceals their intent until the transaction is finalized, to prevent manipulation by other actors. Rook incentivizes participants, including keepers to collaborate in capturing MEV opportunities and distributes the profits among them and ROOK token holders, fostering a more cooperative and less predatory ecosystem within the Ethereum network.</p>
